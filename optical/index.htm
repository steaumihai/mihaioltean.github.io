		<p>The purpose of this research is to use light and other signals to perform computations. Several devices for solving NP-complete problems have been proposed. This kind of solving problems is also called <i>computation with time-delays</i>.</p>
		
		<h2>Here are some properties of light useful for our system:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>light has a limited speed, and thus we can delay it</li>
			<li>due to the massive parallelism, light rays can be divided into 2 
			(sub)rays of smaller intensity.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Basic ideas:</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Optical computing devices are very simple having a graph-like structure. 
		Each device usually has a start node (where the light/signal enters) and a 
		destination node (where the light/signal is expected to come out).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>The light 
		is marked in each node or in each arc so that it can be easily 
		identified at the destination node. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>The <i>marking</i> operation can be 
		implemented by delaying the light by a certain amount of time. A delay 
		can be obtained by forcing the ray to pass through a cable of a given 
		length. Sometime this way to solve problems is also called <i>computations with time-delays.</i></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Later, each ray of light is divided into several small rays 
		which are sent to the outgoing links. This operation can be implemented 
		by using several beam-splitters (half silvered mirrors).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>At the destination node we will 
		search for a particular ray which have a particular property required by 
		the problem. This operation can be done easily due to the special 
		properties of the system which delays the rays passing through a node.</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Problems that have been solved by using this idea:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>

			Hamiltonian path problem</a>

	equations</a></p></li>

	</p></li>

</ul>
<h2>Strengths</h2>
		<p>On some problems it can be faster than digital computers.</p>
		<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
		<p>The required amount of energy is exponential.</p> 
		<p>Note that this difficulty is not specific to this system only. Other major 
		unconventional computation paradigms, trying to solve NP-complete 
		problems share the same fate. For instance, a quantity of DNA equal to 
		the mass of Earth is required to solve Hamiltonian Path problem with 200 
		cities using DNA computers</p>
