			<h2>Abstract: </h2>
			<p>
			In this paper we suggest the use of light for performing useful 
			computations. Namely, we propose a special device which uses light 
			rays for solving the Hamiltonian path problem on a directed graph. 
			The device has a graph-like representation and the light is 
			traversing it following the routes given by the connections between 
			nodes. In each node the rays are uniquely marked so that they can be 
			easily identified. At the destination node we will search only for 
			particular rays that have passed only once through each node. We 
			show that the proposed device can solve small and medium instances 
			of the problem in reasonable time.</p>

		<h2 class="section"><a name="htoc1">1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		Using the light to perform computations is an exciting idea whose 
		applications can be already seen on the market.</p>
		<br/>
		An important step was made by Intel researchers who have developed the 
		first continuous wave all-silicon laser using a physical property called 
		the Raman Effect [<a href="#Faist"><cite>7</cite></a><cite>, </cite>
		<a href="#Paniccia"><cite>16</cite></a><cite>, </cite><a href="#rong1">
		<cite>17</cite></a><cite>, </cite><a href="#rong2"><cite>18</cite></a>]. 
		The device could lead to such practical applications as optical 
		amplifiers, lasers, wavelength converters, and new kinds of lossless 
		optical devices.<br/>
		<br/>
		Another solution comes from Lenslet [<a href="#lenslet"><cite>13</cite></a>] 
		which has created a very fast processor for vector-matrix 
		multiplications. This processor can perform up to 8000 Giga 
		Multiple-Accumulate instructions per second. Lenslet technology has 
		already been applied to data analysis using k-mean algorithm [<a href="#kmean"><cite>15</cite></a>] 
		and video compression.<br/>
		<br/>
		In this paper we suggest a new way of performing computations by using 
		some properties of light waves. The idea may be used within a special 
		device for solving the Hamiltonian path problem.<br/>
		<br/>
		We are not taking into account the quantum properties of light which 
		have been used for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem [<a href="#cerny"><cite>4</cite></a><cite>,
		</cite><a href="#greenwood"><cite>10</cite></a>].<br/>
		<br/>
		The paper is organized as follows: The Hamiltonian path problem is 
		briefly described in section <a href="#HP">2</a>. The proposed device is 
		presented in section <a href="#proposed">3</a>. Mathematical background 
		of the labeling system is described in section <a href="#math">3.2</a>. 
		The way in which the proposed device works is given in section
		<a href="#howorks">3.3</a>. A list of components required by the 
		proposed device is given in section <a href="#hard">3.4</a>. Complexity 
		is discussed in section <a href="#complexity">3.5</a>. Suggestions for 
		improving the device are given in sections <a href="#speed_reduce">3.8</a> 
		and <a href="#particular_graphs">3.9</a>. Further work directions are 
		suggested in section <a href="#further">4</a>.<br/>
		<br/>
&nbsp;<h2 class="section"><a name="htoc2">2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hamiltonian path problem</h2>
		The description of the Hamiltonian Path (HP) problem for a direct graph 
		is the following:<br/>
		<br/>
		Given a directed graph <i>G</i> = (<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>) with |<i>V</i>| =
		<i>n</i> nodes and a start node (<i>v</i><sub><i>start</i></sub>) and a 
		stop node (<i>v</i><sub><i>stop</i></sub>), the problem asks to compute 
		is there is a simple path, beginning with node <i>v</i><sub><i>start</i></sub> 
		and ending with node <i>v</i><sub><i>stop</i></sub>, containing all 
		nodes exactly once. The output for this decision problem is either YES 
		or NO depending on whether the Hamiltonian path does exist or not.<br/>
		<br/>
		The Hamiltonian path problem arises in many real-word applications [<a href="#Ascheuer"><cite>3</cite></a><cite>,
		</cite><a href="#Doniach"><cite>6</cite></a>].<br/>
		<br/>
		The problem belongs to the class of NP-complete problems [<a href="#garey"><cite>9</cite></a>]. 
		No polynomial time algorithm is known for it. <br/>
		<br/>
		A small instance of this problem was also the first problem solved using 
		a DNA computer [<a href="#adleman"><cite>1</cite></a>].<br/>
		<br/>
&nbsp;<h2 class="section"><a name="htoc3">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed device</h2>
		Our idea is based on two properties of light: 
		<ul class="itemize">
			<li class="li-itemize">The speed of light has a limit. The value of 
			the limit is not very important at this stage of explanation. What 
			is important is the fact that we can delay the ray by forcing it to 
			pass through an optical fiber cable of a certain length.<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">The ray can be easily divided into multiple 
			rays of smaller intensity/power.</li>
		</ul>
		Initially a light ray is sent to the start node. Generally speaking two 
		operations must be performed when a ray passes through a node : 
		<ul class="itemize">
			<li class="li-itemize">The light ray is marked uniquely so that we 
			know that it has passed through that node.<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">The ray is divided into a number of rays 
			equal to the external degree of that node. Each obtained ray is 
			directed toward one of the nodes connected to the current node.</li>
		</ul>
		At the destination node we will search only for particular rays that 
		have passed only once through each node.<br/>
		<br/>
		This section deeply describes the proposed system. First step is to find 
		a way to mark the signals which passes through nodes such that the 
		interesting signals can be easily identified at the destination node. 
		The mathematical background required for this operation is described in 
		section <a href="#math">3.2</a> and the hardware implementation of the 
		labeling system is described in section <a href="#hard">3.4</a>.<br/>
		<br/>
&nbsp;<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc4">3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Labeling system</h3>
		At the destination node we will wait for a particular ray which has 
		passed through all nodes of the graph exactly once. This is why we need 
		to find a way to label that particular ray so that it could be easily 
		identified. <br/>
		<br/>
		Actually we are interested in marking all rays which pass through a 
		particular node with a unique label, such that Hamiltonian path is 
		uniquely identified at the destination node (<i>v</i><sub><i>stop</i></sub>).<br/>
		<br/>
		In the solution proposed in this paper, the rays passing through a node 
		are marked by delaying them with a certain amount of time. This delay 
		can be easily obtained by forcing the rays to pass through an optical 
		fiber of a certain length. Roughly speaking, we will know if a certain 
		ray has traversed a Hamiltonian path only if its delay (at the 
		destination node) is equal to the sum of delays of all nodes in that 
		graph. We will also know the particular moment when the expected ray 
		(the one which has completed a Hamiltonian path) will arrive. In this 
		case the only thing that we have to do is to &quot;listen&quot; if there is a 
		fluctuation in the intensity of the signal at that particular moment. 
		Due to the special properties of the proposed system we know that no 
		other ray will arrive, at the destination node, at the moment when the 
		Hamiltonian path ray has arrived.<br/>
		<br/>
		The delays, which are introduced by each node, cannot take any values. 
		If we would put random values for delays we might have different rays 
		(which are not Hamiltonian paths) arriving, at the destination node, in 
		the same time with a ray representing a Hamiltonian path.<br/>
		<br/>
		We need only the ray, which has traversed a Hamiltonian path, to arrive 
		in the destination node at the moment equal to the sum of delays of each 
		node (the moment when the ray has entered in the start node is 
		considered moment 0). Thus, the delaying system must have the following 
		property:<br/>
		<b>Property of the delaying system</b><br/>
		<br/>
		Let us denote by <i>d</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>d</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>d</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> 
		the delays introduced by each node of the graph. A correct set of values 
		for this system must satisfy the condition:<br/>
		<br/>
		<i>d</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>d</i><sub>2</sub>+...+<i>d</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> 
		&#8800; <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> * <i>d</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>a</i><sub>2</sub> * <i>
		d</i><sub>2</sub>+...+<i>a</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> * <i>d</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>,<br/>
		<br/>
		where <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> (1 &#8804; <i>i</i> &#8804; <i>n</i>) are natural 
		numbers and cannot be all 1 in the same time. <br/>
		<br/>
		If a given value <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is strictly greater than 1 
		it means that the ray has passed at least twice through node 1.<br/>
		<br/>
&nbsp;<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc5">3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematical background 
		for the labeling system</h3>
		Finding the appropriate labeling system was two steps process. First of 
		all we have written a computer program which generates this numbers by 
		using a backtracking procedure [<a href="#cormen1"><cite>5</cite></a>]. 
		We also wanted to generate numbers such that the highest number in a 
		system is the smallest possible. This will ensure that the network is 
		constructed in an efficient way. The labeling systems generated by our 
		computer programs are given in Table <a href="#tab_labeling_system">1</a>.

		From Table <a href="#tab_labeling_system">1</a> it can easily seen these 
		numbers follow a general rule:<br/>
		<br/>
		For a graph with <i>n</i> nodes one of the possible labeling systems is:<br/>
		2<sup><i>n</i></sup>&#8722;2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;1</sup>, <br/>
		<br/>
		2<sup><i>n</i></sup>&#8722;2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;2</sup>, <br/>
		<br/>
		2<sup><i>n</i></sup>&#8722;2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;3</sup>, <br/>
		<br/>
		... ,<br/>
		<br/>
		2<sup><i>n</i></sup>&#8722;2<sup>0</sup>. <br/>
		As the second step we have to prove that the property of delaying system 
		(see section <a href="#labeling">3.1</a>) holds for this sequence of 
		numbers.<br/>
		<br/>
		Actually we have to prove that the equality:<br/>

		<br/>
		is not possible unless all <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> are equal to 1.<br/>
		The left part of the equality is:<br/>
		2<sup><i>n</i></sup>&#8722;2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;1</sup> + 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>&#8722;2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;2</sup> 
		+ 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>&#8722;2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;3</sup> + ... + 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>&#8722;2<sup>0</sup> 
		=<br/>
		<i>n</i> * 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> &#8722; (2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;1</sup> + 2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;2</sup> 
		+ 2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;3</sup> + ... + 2<sup>0</sup>) =<br/>
		<i>n</i> * 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> &#8722; 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> + 1 =<br/>
		(<i>n</i> &#8722; 1) * 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> + 1.<br/>
		First of all we have to see that the equality does not hold if all <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> 
		numbers are at least 1 and at least one number is strictly greater than 
		1. If this happens the 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> term will be represented at 
		least <i>n</i> times. But, it must be represented only <i>n</i>&#8722;1 times 
		(see above).<br/>
		<br/>
		Thus, if at least one number <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is strictly 
		greater than 1, it means that other numbers <i>a</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> 
		must be 0. We will prove that the equality (1) does not hold in this 
		case too.<br/>
		<br/>
		As discussed above, if one of the coefficients is 0, at least one of the 
		other coefficients must be strictly greater than 1. For instance, if <i>
		a</i><sub>1</sub> is set to 0, it means that <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> must 
		be set to 3 in order to compensate the missing 2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;1</sup> 
		term. This is a direct consequence of the fact that 2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;1</sup> 
		= 2 &#8901; 2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;2</sup>. Of course, we also have to take into 
		account that 2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;2</sup> must be represented once. This is 
		why we have to set <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> to value 3.<br/>
		<br/>
		If <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> is also 0 we have to set <i>a</i><sub>3</sub> to 
		value 7 (we need 4 * 2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;3</sup> in order to compensate the 
		missing term 2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;1</sup>, we also need 2 * 2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;3</sup> 
		to compensate the missing term 2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;2</sup> and, of course, 
		the term 2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;3</sup> must be represented 1 time).<br/>
		<br/>
		As a general idea: if a particular term (2<sup><i>n</i>&#8722;<i>j</i></sup>) 
		is missing (the corresponding coefficient <i>a</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> is 
		set to 0), it can be compensate by setting one of the next coefficients 
		to a value of at least 3. But, a coefficient set to 0 means that the 
		term 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> is missing once, and by setting another 
		coefficient to at least 3 we will get at least 2 extra representations 
		for 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>. This will mean that right part of the equation 
		(1) will be at least (<i>n</i>+1) * 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> + 1. But, the 
		left part of the equation is only (<i>n</i>&#8722;1) * 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> + 
		1.<br/>
		<br/>
		With this we have shown that all <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> (1 &#8804; <i>i</i> 
		&#8804; <i>n</i>) must be 1 in order to have equality in equation (1). For any 
		other values of <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> the equality (1) does not 
		hold.<br/>
		<br/>
		An important question is whether this system is the minimal possible 
		(the biggest number is the minimal possible). A partial answer to this 
		question is given in section <a href="#complexity">3.5</a>.

		An schematic example of a graph-like system is given in Figure
		<a href="#graph_fig">1</a>.<br/>
		<br/>
		In the graph depicted in Figure <a href="#graph_fig">1</a> the light 
		will enter in node 1. It will be delayed with a certain amount of time 
		and then it will be divided into 2 rays which will be sent to the nodes 
		3 and 5. In node 3 the ray will be delayed (with the amount of time 
		corresponding to node 3) and then it will be sent to node 4. However, 
		this is not a Hamiltonian path because it has visited only the nodes 1, 
		3 and 4. The other ray which was sent to node 5 (from node 1) can 
		generate a Hamiltonian path by following the route 1, 5, 2, 3 4.<br/>
		<br/>
		Note that there is also a cycle in the graph: 1, 5, 2. The cycle will 
		make that some particular rays to be trapped within the system. The rays 
		which have passed once through the previously described cycle are not 
		considered Hamiltonian paths because the moments when they arrive at the 
		destination node are greater than the sum of delays introduced by each 
		node.<br/>

&nbsp;<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc7">3.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardware implementation of 
		the labeling system</h3>
		For implementing the proposed device we need the following components: 
		<ul class="itemize">
			<li class="li-itemize">a source of light (laser),<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">Several beam-splitters for dividing light 
			rays into multiple subrays. A standard beam-splitter is designed 
			using a half-silvered mirror. For dividing a ray into <i>k</i> 
			subrays we need <i>k</i>&#8722;1 beam-splitters.<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">A high speed photodiode for converting light 
			rays into electrical power. The photodiode is placed in the 
			destination node.<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">A tool for detecting fluctuations in the 
			intensity of electric power generated by the photodiode 
			(oscilloscope),<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">A set of optical fiber cables having certain 
			lengths. These cables are used for connecting nodes and for delaying 
			the signals within nodes. The length of the cables must obey the 
			rules described in section <a href="#labeling">3.1</a>. A practical 
			example is given in section <a href="#psize">3.6</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc8">3.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Complexity</h3>
		This section answers a very important question: <i>Why the proposed 
		approach is not a polynomial-time solution for the HP problem?</i><br/>
		<br/>
		At the first sight one may be tempted to say that the proposed approach 
		provides a solution in polynomial time to any instance of the HP 
		problem. The reason behind such claim is given by the ability of the 
		proposed device to provide output to any instance by traversing only 
		once all nodes (O(<i>n</i>) complexity). This could mean that we have 
		found a polynomial-time algorithm for the HP problem. A direct 
		consequence is obtaining solutions, in polynomial time, for all other 
		NP-Complete problems - since there is a polynomial reduction between 
		them [<a href="#garey"><cite>9</cite></a>].<br/>
		<br/>
		However, this is not our case. As can be seen from Table
		<a href="#tab_labeling_system">1</a> the delay time increases 
		exponentially with the number of nodes. Even if the ray has to traverse 
		only <i>n</i> nodes (resulting a complexity of O(<i>n</i>)), the total 
		time required by the ray to reach the destination node increases 
		exponentially with the number of nodes.<br/>
		<br/>
		There are two direct consequences which are derived from here: 
		<ul class="itemize">
			<li class="li-itemize">The length of the optical fibers, used for 
			delaying the signals, increases exponentially with the number of 
			nodes,<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">The intensity of the signal decreases 
			exponentially with the number of nodes that are traversed.</li>
		</ul>
		These two issues are discussed in sections <a href="#psize">3.6</a> and
		<a href="#amplify">3.7</a>.<br/>
		<br/>
&nbsp;<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc9">3.6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem size</h3>
		We are interested in computing the size of the cables required to solve 
		a certain instance of the problem in a small amount of time. This will 
		give as a rough indication on the size of the graphs that can be solved 
		using our system in reasonable time.<br/>
		<br/>
		This size heavily depends on the accuracy of the measurement tools. The 
		rise-time of the best oscilloscope available on the market is in the 
		range of picoseconds (10<sup>&#8722;12</sup> seconds). This means that we 
		should not have two signals that arrive at 2 consecutive moments at a 
		difference smaller than 10<sup>&#8722;12</sup> seconds.<br/>
		<br/>
		Knowing that the speed of light is 3 * 10<sup>8</sup> <i>m</i>/<i>s</i> 
		we can easily compute the minimal cable length that should be traversed 
		by the ray in order to be delayed with 10<sup>&#8722;12</sup> seconds. This is 
		obviously 0.0003 meters.<br/>
		<br/>
		This value is the minimal delay that should be introduced by a node in 
		order to ensure that the difference between the moments when two 
		consecutive signals arrive at the destination node is greater or equal 
		to the measurable unit of 10<sup>&#8722;12</sup> seconds. This will also 
		ensure that we will be able to correctly identify whether the signal has 
		arrived in the destination node at a moment equal to the sum of delays 
		introduced by each node. No other signals will arrive within a range of 
		10<sup>&#8722;12</sup> seconds around that particular moment.<br/>
		<br/>
		Once we have the length for that minimal delay is quite easy to compute 
		the length of the other cables that are used in order to induce a 
		certain delay.<br/>
		<br/>
		Recall from section <a href="#math">3.2</a>, Table
		<a href="#tab_labeling_system">1</a> that a graph with 5 nodes has the 
		following delaying system:<br/>
		16, 24, 28, 30, 31.<p>From the previous reasoning line we have deduced 
		that the smaller indivisible unit is 0.0003. So, we have to multiply 
		these numbers by 0.0003. We obtain: <br/>
		0.00048, 0.00072, 0.00084, 0.0009, 0.00093.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
		<p>These numbers represent the length of the cables that must be used in 
		graph's nodes in order to induce a certain delay.<br/>
		<br/>
		Note that the delay introduced by the cables connecting the nodes was 
		not taken into account in this example. This is not a limitation of our 
		system. The cables connecting nodes can be set to have some length which 
		must obey the property of delaying system (see section
		<a href="#labeling">3.1</a>). Note that all cables must have the same 
		length. In this case if we have a graph with 4 nodes the length of every 
		cable connecting the nodes must be set to 16 units (the shortest 
		possible - in order to reduce the costs). The length of cables within 
		the nodes should be 24, 28, 30 and 31 units.<br/>
		<br/>
		The largest length in this sequence is 0.00093 meters. This length is 
		not very big, but for larger graphs the length of the cables within 
		nodes can be a problem.<br/>
		<br/>
		Once we have the length for that minimal delay is quite easy to compute 
		the maximal number of nodes that a graph can have in order to find the 
		Hamiltonian path in one second. We know the facts: </p>
		<ul class="itemize">
			<li class="li-itemize">the largest delay has the form 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> 
			&#8722; 1 (see equation <a href="#eq1">1</a>), 
			</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">the distance traversed by light in 1 second 
			is 3 * 10<sup>8</sup> meters,<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">the shortest delay possible is 0.0003 meters.</li>
		</ul>
		We simply have to solve the equation:<br/>
		<br/>
&nbsp;<div class="center">
			2<sup><i>n</i></sup> * 0.0003 = 3 * 10<sup>8</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)</div>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		This number is about 40 nodes. However, the length of the optic fibers 
		used for inducing the largest delay for this graph is huge: about 8 * 10<sup>8</sup> 
		meters. We cannot expect to have such long cables for our experiments.<br/>
		<br/>
		However, shorter cables (of several hundreds of kilometers) are already 
		available in the internet networks. They can be easily used for our 
		purpose. Assuming that the longest cable that we have is about 300 
		kilometers we may solve instances with about 26 nodes. The amount of 
		time required to obtain a solution is about 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> seconds. <br/>
		<br/>
		Note that the maximal number of nodes can be increased when the 
		precision of our measurement instruments (oscilloscope and photodiode) 
		is increased. <br/>
		<br/>
		Also note that this difficulty is not specific to our system only. Other 
		major unconventional computation paradigms, trying to solve NP-complete 
		problems share the same fate. For instance, a quantity of DNA equal to 
		the mass of Earth is required to solve HP instances of 200 cities using 
		DNA computers [<a href="#Hartmanis"><cite>11</cite></a>].<br/>
		<br/>
&nbsp;<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc10">3.7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Amplifying the signal</h3>
		Beam splitters are used in our approach for dividing a ray in two or 
		more subrays. Because of that, the intensity of the signal is 
		decreasing. In the worst case we have an exponential decrease of the 
		intensity. For instance, in a graph with <i>n</i> nodes, each signal is 
		divided (within each node) into <i>n</i> &#8722; 1 signals. Roughly speaking, 
		the intensity of the signal will decrease <i>n</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> 
		times.<br/>
		<br/>
		This means that, at the destination node, we have to be able to detect 
		very small fluctuations in the intensity of the signal. For this purpose 
		we will use a photomultiplier [<a href="#Flyckt"><cite>8</cite></a>] 
		which is an extremely sensitive detector of light in the ultraviolet, 
		visible and near infrared range. This detector multiplies the signal 
		produced by incident light by as much as 10<sup>8</sup>, from which even 
		single photons can be detected.<br/>
		<br/>
&nbsp;<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc11">3.8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving the device by 
		reducing the speed of the signal</h3>
		The speed of the light in optic fibers is an important parameter in our 
		device. The problem is that the light is too fast for our measurement 
		tools. We have either to increase the precision of our measurement tools 
		or to decrease the speed of light.<br/>
		<br/>
		It is known that the speed of light traversing a cable is significantly 
		smaller than the speed of light in the void space. Commercially 
		available cables have limit the speed of the ray wave up to 60% from the 
		original speed of light. This means that we can obtain the same delay by 
		using a shorter cable.<br/>
		<br/>
		However, this method for reducing the speed of light is not enough. The 
		order of magnitude is still the same. This is why we have the search for 
		other methods for reducing that speed. A very interesting solution was 
		proposed in [<a href="#Hau"><cite>12</cite></a><cite>, </cite>
		<a href="#Liu"><cite>14</cite></a>] which is able to reduce the speed of 
		light by 7 orders of magnitude. This could help our mechanism 
		significantly. However, is still a question how to use this idea for our 
		device because of the complex equipment involved in those experiments [<a href="#Hau"><cite>12</cite></a><cite>,
		</cite><a href="#Liu"><cite>14</cite></a>].<br/>
		<br/>
		By reducing the speed of light by 7 orders of magnitude we can reduce 
		the size of the involved cables by a similar order. This will help us to 
		solve larger instances of the problem.<br/>
		<br/>
&nbsp;<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc12">3.9</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving the performance 
		of the device for particular graphs</h3>
		The labeling system proposed in section <a href="#labeling">3.1</a> is a 
		general one. It can be used for any kind of graph (with any number of 
		nodes and arcs). We have shown that this system has a big problem: the 
		value of the involved numbers increase exponentially with the number of 
		nodes in the graph being solved.<br/>
		<br/>
		But, for particular graphs we can find other labeling systems which are 
		not exponential. For example, the linear graph (see Figure
		<a href="#fig_linear_graph">2</a> can be solved by our device by using 
		virtually no delays. In this case the moment when the signal arrives in 
		the destination node is equal to sum of delays introduced by the cables 
		connecting the nodes.

				for the nodes of this graph in order to find an Hamiltonian path</div>
			<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</blockquote>
		Finding the optimal labeling system for a particular graph is an 
		interesting problem which will be investigated in the near future.<br/>
		<br/>
&nbsp;<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc13">3.10</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical challenges</h3>
		There are many technical challenges that must be solved when 
		implementing the proposed device. Some of them are: 
		<ul class="itemize">
			<li class="li-itemize">Cutting the optic fibers to an exact length 
			with high precision. Failing to accomplish this task can lead to 
			errors in detecting a ray which has passed through each node once.<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">Finding a high precision oscilloscope. This 
			is an essential step for solving larger instances of the problem 
			(see section <a href="#psize">3.6</a>),<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">Finding cables long enough so that larger 
			instances of the problem could be solve. This problem might have a 
			simple solution: the internet networks connecting the world cities. 
			It is easy to find cables of hundreds of kilometers connecting 
			distant cities. This will help us to solve instance of more than 10 
			nodes. However, this solution introduces a difficulty too: cables of 
			certain lengths must be found or the system must be rescaled in 
			order to fit the existing lengths.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="section"><a name="htoc14">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusions and further work</h2>
		The way in which light can be used for performing useful computations 
		has been suggested in this paper. The techniques are based on the 
		massive parallelism of the light ray.<br/>
		<br/>
		It has been shown the way in which a light-based device can be used for 
		solving the Hamiltonian path problem. Using the today technology we can 
		build a light-based device which can solve small and medium size 
		instances in several seconds.<br/>
		<br/>
		Further work directions will be focused on: 
		<ul class="itemize">
			<li class="li-itemize">Implementing the proposed hardware,<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">Finding optimal labeling systems for 
			particular graphs. This will reduce the length of the involved 
			cables significantly,<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">Finding other non-trivial problems which can 
			be solved by using the proposed device,<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">Finding other ways to introduce delays in the 
			system. The current solution requires cables that are too long and 
			too expensive,<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">Using other type of signals instead of light. 
			A possible candidate would be electric power,<br/>
			<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li class="li-itemize">Finding other ways to implement the system of 
			marking the signals which pass through a particular node. This will 
			be very useful because the currently suggested system, based on 
			delays, is too time consuming.</li>
