	In this paper we suggest the use of light for performing useful 
	computations. Namely, we propose a special device which uses light rays for 
	solving the Hamiltonian path problem on a directed graph. The device has a 
	graph-like representation and the light is traversing it following the 
	routes given by the connections between nodes. In each node the rays are 
	uniquely marked so that they can be easily identified. At the destination 
	node we will search only for particular rays that have passed only once 
	through each node. We show that the proposed device can solve small and 
	medium instances of the problem in reasonable time.</p>

Using the light to perform computations is an exciting idea whose applications 
can be already seen on the market.<BR>
<BR>
An important step was made by Intel researchers who have developed the first 
continuous wave all-silicon laser using a physical property called the Raman 
Effect [<A HREF="#Faist"><CITE>7</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#Paniccia"><CITE>
16</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#rong1"><CITE>17</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#rong2"><CITE>
18</CITE></A>]. The device could lead to such practical applications as optical 
amplifiers, lasers, wavelength converters, and new kinds of lossless optical 
devices.<BR>
<BR>
Another solution comes from Lenslet [<A HREF="#lenslet"><CITE>13</CITE></A>] 
which has created a very fast processor for vector-matrix multiplications. This 
processor can perform up to 8000 Giga Multiple-Accumulate instructions per 
second. Lenslet technology has already been applied to data analysis using 
k-mean algorithm [<A HREF="#kmean"><CITE>15</CITE></A>] and video compression.<BR>
<BR>
In this paper we suggest a new way of performing computations by using some 
properties of light waves. The idea may be used within a special device for 
solving the Hamiltonian path problem.<BR>
<BR>
We are not taking into account the quantum properties of light which have been 
used for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem [<A HREF="#cerny"><CITE>4</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#greenwood"><CITE>
10</CITE></A>].<BR>
<BR>
The paper is organized as follows: The Hamiltonian path problem is briefly 
described in section <A HREF="#HP">2</A>. The proposed device is presented in 
section <A HREF="#proposed">3</A>. Mathematical background of the labeling 
system is described in section <A HREF="#math">3.2</A>. The way in which the 
proposed device works is given in section <A HREF="#howorks">3.3</A>. A list of 
components required by the proposed device is given in section <A HREF="#hard">
3.4</A>. Complexity is discussed in section <A HREF="#complexity">3.5</A>. 
Suggestions for improving the device are given in sections <A HREF="#speed_reduce">
3.8</A> and <A HREF="#particular_graphs">3.9</A>. Further work directions are 
suggested in section <A HREF="#further">4</A>.<BR>

<A NAME="HP"></A>
The description of the Hamiltonian Path (HP) problem for a direct graph is the 
following:<BR>
<BR>
Given a directed graph <I>G</I> = (<I>V</I>, <I>E</I>) with |<I>V</I>| = <I>n</I> 
nodes and a start node (<I>v</I><SUB><I>start</I></SUB>) and a stop node (<I>v</I><SUB><I>stop</I></SUB>), 
the problem asks to compute is there is a simple path, beginning with node <I>v</I><SUB><I>start</I></SUB> 
and ending with node <I>v</I><SUB><I>stop</I></SUB>, containing all nodes 
exactly once. The output for this decision problem is either YES or NO depending 
on whether the Hamiltonian path does exist or not.<BR>
<BR>
The Hamiltonian path problem arises in many real-word applications [<A HREF="#Ascheuer"><CITE>3</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#Doniach"><CITE>
6</CITE></A>].<BR>
<BR>
The problem belongs to the class of NP-complete problems [<A HREF="#garey"><CITE>9</CITE></A>]. 
No polynomial time algorithm is known for it. <BR>
<BR>
A small instance of this problem was also the first problem solved using a DNA 
computer [<A HREF="#adleman"><CITE>1</CITE></A>].<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section The proposed device-->

<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc3">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed device</H2><!--SEC END -->

<A NAME="proposed"></A>
Our idea is based on two properties of light:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The speed of light has a limit. The 
	value of the limit is not very important at this stage of explanation. What 
	is important is the fact that we can delay the ray by forcing it to pass 
	through an optical fiber cable of a certain length.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">The ray can be easily divided into multiple rays of 
smaller intensity/power.</UL>
Initially a light ray is sent to the start node. Generally speaking two 
operations must be performed when a ray passes through a node :
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The light ray is marked uniquely so 
	that we know that it has passed through that node.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">The ray is divided into a number of rays equal to the 
external degree of that node. Each obtained ray is directed toward one of the 
nodes connected to the current node.</UL>
At the destination node we will search only for particular rays that have passed 
only once through each node.<BR>
<BR>
This section deeply describes the proposed system. First step is to find a way 
to mark the signals which passes through nodes such that the interesting signals 
can be easily identified at the destination node. The mathematical background 
required for this operation is described in section <A HREF="#math">3.2</A> and 
the hardware implementation of the labeling system is described in section <A HREF="#hard">
3.4</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Labeling system-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc4">3.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Labeling system</H3><!--SEC END -->

<A NAME="labeling"></A>
At the destination node we will wait for a particular ray which has passed 
through all nodes of the graph exactly once. This is why we need to find a way 
to label that particular ray so that it could be easily identified. <BR>
<BR>
Actually we are interested in marking all rays which pass through a particular 
node with a unique label, such that Hamiltonian path is uniquely identified at 
the destination node (<I>v</I><SUB><I>stop</I></SUB>).<BR>
<BR>
In the solution proposed in this paper, the rays passing through a node are 
marked by delaying them with a certain amount of time. This delay can be easily 
obtained by forcing the rays to pass through an optical fiber of a certain 
length. Roughly speaking, we will know if a certain ray has traversed a 
Hamiltonian path only if its delay (at the destination node) is equal to the sum 
of delays of all nodes in that graph. We will also know the particular moment 
when the expected ray (the one which has completed a Hamiltonian path) will 
arrive. In this case the only thing that we have to do is to &quot;listen&quot; if there 
is a fluctuation in the intensity of the signal at that particular moment. Due 
to the special properties of the proposed system we know that no other ray will 
arrive, at the destination node, at the moment when the Hamiltonian path ray has 
arrived.<BR>
<BR>
The delays, which are introduced by each node, cannot take any values. If we 
would put random values for delays we might have different rays (which are not 
Hamiltonian paths) arriving, at the destination node, in the same time with a 
ray representing a Hamiltonian path.<BR>
<BR>
We need only the ray, which has traversed a Hamiltonian path, to arrive in the 
destination node at the moment equal to the sum of delays of each node (the 
moment when the ray has entered in the start node is considered moment 0). Thus, 
the delaying system must have the following property:<BR>
<B>Property of the delaying system</B><BR>
<BR>
Let us denote by <I>d</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>d</I><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <I>d</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB> 
the delays introduced by each node of the graph. A correct set of values for 
this system must satisfy the condition:<BR>
<BR>
<I>d</I><SUB>1</SUB>+<I>d</I><SUB>2</SUB>+...+<I>d</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB> &#8800; <I>a</I><SUB>1</SUB> 
&#8901; <I>d</I><SUB>1</SUB>+<I>a</I><SUB>2</SUB> &#8901; <I>d</I><SUB>2</SUB>+...+<I>a</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB> 
&#8901; <I>d</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB>,<BR>
<BR>
where <I>a</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> (1 &#8804; <I>i</I> &#8804; <I>n</I>) are natural numbers 
and cannot be all 1 in the same time. <BR>
<BR>
If a given value <I>a</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> is strictly greater than 1 it means 
that the ray has passed at least twice through node 1.<BR>

Finding the appropriate labeling system was two steps process. First of all we 
have written a computer program which generates this numbers by using a 
backtracking procedure [<A HREF="#cormen1"><CITE>5</CITE></A>]. We also wanted 
to generate numbers such that the highest number in a system is the smallest 
possible. This will ensure that the network is constructed in an efficient way. 
The labeling systems generated by our computer programs are given in Table <A HREF="#tab_labeling_system">

From Table <A HREF="#tab_labeling_system">1</A> it can easily seen these numbers 
follow a general rule:<BR>
<BR>
For a graph with <I>n</I> nodes one of the possible labeling systems is:<BR>
2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>&#8722;2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;1</SUP>, <BR>
<BR>
2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>&#8722;2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;2</SUP>, <BR>

<BR>
... ,<BR>
<BR>
2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>&#8722;2<SUP>0</SUP>. <BR>
As the second step we have to prove that the property of delaying system (see 
section <A HREF="#labeling">3.1</A>) holds for this sequence of numbers.<BR>
<BR>
Actually we have to prove that the equality:<BR>

</TR></TABLE></DIV><BR>
is not possible unless all <I>a</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> are equal to 1.<BR>
The left part of the equality is:<BR>
2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>&#8722;2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;1</SUP> + 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>&#8722;2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;2</SUP> 
+ 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>&#8722;2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;3</SUP> + ... + 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>&#8722;2<SUP>0</SUP>

<I>n</I> &#8901; 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP> &#8722; (2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;1</SUP> + 2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;2</SUP> 
+ 2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;3</SUP> + ... + 2<SUP>0</SUP>) =<BR>
<I>n</I> &#8901; 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP> &#8722; 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP> + 1 =<BR>
(<I>n</I> &#8722; 1) &#8901; 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP> + 1.<BR>
First of all we have to see that the equality does not hold if all <I>a</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> 
numbers are at least 1 and at least one number is strictly greater than 1. If 
this happens the 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP> term will be represented at least <I>n</I> 
times. But, it must be represented only <I>n</I>&#8722;1 times (see above).<BR>
<BR>
Thus, if at least one number <I>a</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> is strictly greater 
than 1, it means that other numbers <I>a</I><SUB><I>j</I></SUB> must be 0. We 
will prove that the equality (1) does not hold in this case too.<BR>
<BR>
As discussed above, if one of the coefficients is 0, at least one of the other 
coefficients must be strictly greater than 1. For instance, if <I>a</I><SUB>1</SUB> 
is set to 0, it means that <I>a</I><SUB>2</SUB> must be set to 3 in order to 
compensate the missing 2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;1</SUP> term. This is a direct consequence 
of the fact that 2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;1</SUP> = 2 &#8901; 2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;2</SUP>. Of course, 
we also have to take into account that 2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;2</SUP> must be 
represented once. This is why we have to set <I>a</I><SUB>2</SUB> to value 3.<BR>
<BR>
If <I>a</I><SUB>2</SUB> is also 0 we have to set <I>a</I><SUB>3</SUB> to value 7 
(we need 4 &#8901; 2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;3</SUP> in order to compensate the missing term 2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;1</SUP>, 
we also need 2 &#8901; 2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;3</SUP> to compensate the missing term 2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;2</SUP> 
and, of course, the term 2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;3</SUP> must be represented 1 time).<BR>
<BR>
As a general idea: if a particular term (2<SUP><I>n</I>&#8722;<I>j</I></SUP>) is 
missing (the corresponding coefficient <I>a</I><SUB><I>j</I></SUB> is set to 0), 
it can be compensate by setting one of the next coefficients to a value of at 
least 3. But, a coefficient set to 0 means that the term 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP> is 
missing once, and by setting another coefficient to at least 3 we will get at 
least 2 extra representations for 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>. This will mean that 
right part of the equation (1) will be at least (<I>n</I>+1) &#8901; 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP> 
+ 1. But, the left part of the equation is only (<I>n</I>&#8722;1) &#8901; 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP> 
+ 1.<BR>
<BR>
With this we have shown that all <I>a</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> (1 &#8804; <I>i</I> &#8804; <I>
n</I>) must be 1 in order to have equality in equation (1). For any other values 
of <I>a</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> the equality (1) does not hold.<BR>
<BR>
An important question is whether this system is the minimal possible (the 
biggest number is the minimal possible). A partial answer to this question is 
given in section <A HREF="#complexity">3.5</A>.

An schematic example of a graph-like system is given in Figure <A HREF="#graph_fig">
1</A>.<BR>
<BR>
In the graph depicted in Figure <A HREF="#graph_fig">1</A> the light will enter 
in node 1. It will be delayed with a certain amount of time and then it will be 
divided into 2 rays which will be sent to the nodes 3 and 5. In node 3 the ray 
will be delayed (with the amount of time corresponding to node 3) and then it 
will be sent to node 4. However, this is not a Hamiltonian path because it has 
visited only the nodes 1, 3 and 4. The other ray which was sent to node 5 (from 
node 1) can generate a Hamiltonian path by following the route 1, 5, 2, 3 4.<BR>
<BR>
Note that there is also a cycle in the graph: 1, 5, 2. The cycle will make that 
some particular rays to be trapped within the system. The rays which have passed 
once through the previously described cycle are not considered Hamiltonian paths 
because the moments when they arrive at the destination node are greater than 
the sum of delays introduced by each node.<BR>

This section answers a very important question: <I>Why the proposed approach is 
not a polynomial-time solution for the HP problem?</I><BR>
<BR>
At the first sight one may be tempted to say that the proposed approach provides 
a solution in polynomial time to any instance of the HP problem. The reason 
behind such claim is given by the ability of the proposed device to provide 
output to any instance by traversing only once all nodes (O(<I>n</I>) 
complexity). This could mean that we have found a polynomial-time algorithm for 
the HP problem. A direct consequence is obtaining solutions, in polynomial time, 
for all other NP-Complete problems - since there is a polynomial reduction 
between them [<A HREF="#garey"><CITE>9</CITE></A>].<BR>

However, this is not our case. As can be seen from Table <A HREF="#tab_labeling_system">
1</A> the delay time increases exponentially with the number of nodes. Even if 
the ray has to traverse only <I>n</I> nodes (resulting a complexity of O(<I>n</I>)), 
the total time required by the ray to reach the destination node increases 
exponentially with the number of nodes.<BR>
<BR>
There are two direct consequences which are derived from here:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The length of the optical fibers, 
	used for delaying the signals, increases exponentially with the number of 
	nodes,<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">The intensity of the signal decreases exponentially with 
the number of nodes that are traversed.</UL>
These two issues are discussed in sections <A HREF="#psize">3.6</A> and <A HREF="#amplify">
3.7</A>.<BR>

<!--TOC subsection Problem size-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc9">3.6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem size</H3><!--SEC END -->

<A NAME="psize"></A>
We are interested in computing the size of the cables required to solve a 
certain instance of the problem in a small amount of time. This will give as a 
rough indication on the size of the graphs that can be solved using our system 
in reasonable time.<BR>
<BR>
This size heavily depends on the accuracy of the measurement tools. The 
rise-time of the best oscilloscope available on the market is in the range of 
picoseconds (10<SUP>&#8722;12</SUP> seconds). This means that we should not have two 
signals that arrive at 2 consecutive moments at a difference smaller than 10<SUP>&#8722;12</SUP> 
seconds.<BR>
<BR>
Knowing that the speed of light is 3 &#8901; 10<SUP>11</SUP> <I>m</I>/<I>s</I> we can 
easily compute the minimal cable length that should be traversed by the ray in 
order to be delayed with 10<SUP>&#8722;12</SUP> seconds. This is obviously 0.3 meters.<BR>
<BR>
This value is the minimal delay that should be introduced by a node in order to 
ensure that the difference between the moments when two consecutive signals 
arrive at the destination node is greater or equal to the measurable unit of 10<SUP>&#8722;12</SUP> 
seconds. This will also ensure that we will be able to correctly identify 
whether the signal has arrived in the destination node at a moment equal to the 
sum of delays introduced by each node. No other signals will arrive within a 
range of 10<SUP>&#8722;12</SUP> seconds around that particular moment.<BR>
<BR>
Once we have the length for that minimal delay is quite easy to compute the 
length of the other cables that are used in order to induce a certain delay.<BR>
<BR>
Recall from section <A HREF="#math">3.2</A>, Table <A HREF="#tab_labeling_system">
1</A> that a graph with 5 nodes has the following delaying system:<BR>
16, 24, 28, 30, 31.<BR>
From the previous reasoning line we have deduced that the smaller indivisible 
unit is 0.3. So, we have to multiply these numbers by 0.3. We obtain: <BR>
4.8, 7.2, 8.4, 9.0, 9.3.<BR>
These numbers represent the length of the cables that must be used in graph's 
nodes in order to induce a certain delay.<BR>
<BR>
Note that the delay introduced by the cables connecting the nodes was not taken 
into account in this example. This is not a limitation of our system. The cables 
connecting nodes can be set to have some length which must obey the property of 
delaying system (see section <A HREF="#labeling">3.1</A>). Note that all cables 
must have the same length. In this case if we have a graph with 4 nodes the 
length of every cable connecting the nodes must be set to 16 units (the shortest 
possible - in order to reduce the costs). The length of cables within the nodes 
should be 24, 28, 30 and 31 units.<BR>
<BR>
The largest length in this sequence is 9.3 meters. This length is not very big, 
but for larger graphs the length of the cables within nodes can be a problem.<BR>
<BR>
Once we have the length for that minimal delay is quite easy to compute the 
maximal number of nodes that a graph can have in order to find the Hamiltonian 
path in one second. We know the facts:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">the largest delay has the form 2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP> 
	&#8722; 1 (see equation <A HREF="#eq1">1</A>),
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">the distance traversed by light in 1 second is 3 &#8901; 10<SUP>8</SUP> 
meters,<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">the shortest delay possible is 0.3 meters.</UL>
We simply have to solve the equation:<BR>
<BR>
<DIV CLASS="center">
2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP> &#8901; 0.3 = 3 &#8901; 10<SUP>8</SUP>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)</DIV><BR>
<BR>
This number is about 33 nodes. However, the length of the optic fibers used for 
inducing the largest delay for this graph is huge: about 8 &#8901; 10<SUP>11</SUP> 
meters. We cannot expect to have such long cables for our experiments.<BR>
<BR>
However, shorter cables (of several hundreds of kilometers) are already 
available in the internet networks. They can be easily used for our purpose. 
Assuming that the longest cable that we have is about 300 kilometers we may 
solve instances with about 17 nodes. The amount of time required to obtain a 
solution is about 10<SUP>&#8722;6</SUP> seconds. <BR>
<BR>
Note that the maximal number of nodes can be increased when the precision of our 
measurement instruments (oscilloscope and photodiode) is increased. <BR>
<BR>
Also note that this difficulty is not specific to our system only. Other major 
unconventional computation paradigms, trying to solve NP-complete problems share 
the same fate. For instance, a quantity of DNA equal to the mass of Earth is 
required to solve HP instances of 200 cities using DNA computers [<A HREF="#Hartmanis"><CITE>11</CITE></A>].<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Amplifying the signal-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc10">3.7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Amplifying the signal</H3><!--SEC END -->

<A NAME="amplify"></A>
Beam splitters are used in our approach for dividing a ray in two or more 
subrays. Because of that, the intensity of the signal is decreasing. In the 
worst case we have an exponential decrease of the intensity. For instance, in a 
graph with <I>n</I> nodes, each signal is divided (within each node) into <I>n</I> 
&#8722; 1 signals. Roughly speaking, the intensity of the signal will decrease <I>n</I><SUP><I>n</I></SUP> 
times.<BR>
<BR>
This means that, at the destination node, we have to be able to detect very 
small fluctuations in the intensity of the signal. For this purpose we will use 
a photomultiplier [<A HREF="#Flyckt"><CITE>8</CITE></A>] which is an extremely 
sensitive detector of light in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared range. 
This detector multiplies the signal produced by incident light by as much as 10<SUP>8</SUP>, 
from which even single photons can be detected.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Improving the device by reducing the speed of the signal-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc11">3.8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving the device by 
reducing the speed of the signal</H3><!--SEC END -->

<A NAME="speed_reduce"></A>
The speed of the light in optic fibers is an important parameter in our device. 
The problem is that the light is too fast for our measurement tools. We have 
either to increase the precision of our measurement tools or to decrease the 
speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
It is known that the speed of light traversing a cable is significantly smaller 
than the speed of light in the void space. Commercially available cables have 
limit the speed of the ray wave up to 60% from the original speed of light. This 
means that we can obtain the same delay by using a shorter cable.<BR>
<BR>
However, this method for reducing the speed of light is not enough. The order of 
magnitude is still the same. This is why we have the search for other methods 
for reducing that speed. A very interesting solution was proposed in [<A HREF="#Hau"><CITE>12</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#Liu"><CITE>
14</CITE></A>] which is able to reduce the speed of light by 7 orders of 
magnitude. This could help our mechanism significantly. However, is still a 
question how to use this idea for our device because of the complex equipment 
involved in those experiments [<A HREF="#Hau"><CITE>12</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#Liu"><CITE>
14</CITE></A>].<BR>
<BR>
By reducing the speed of light by 7 orders of magnitude we can reduce the size 
of the involved cables by a similar order. This will help us to solve larger 
instances of the problem.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="particular_graphs"></A>
The labeling system proposed in section <A HREF="#labeling">3.1</A> is a general 
one. It can be used for any kind of graph (with any number of nodes and arcs). 
We have shown that this system has a big problem: the value of the involved 
numbers increase exponentially with the number of nodes in the graph being 
solved.<BR>
<BR>
But, for particular graphs we can find other labeling systems which are not 
exponential. For example, the linear graph (see Figure <A HREF="#fig_linear_graph">
2</A> can be solved by our device by using virtually no delays. In this case the 
moment when the signal arrives in the destination node is equal to sum of delays 
introduced by the cables connecting the nodes.

<!--TOC subsection Technical challenges-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc13">3.10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical challenges</H3><!--SEC END -->

There are many technical challenges that must be solved when implementing the 
proposed device. Some of them are:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Cutting the optic fibers to an exact 
	length with high precision. Failing to accomplish this task can lead to 
	errors in detecting a ray which has passed through each node once.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Finding a high precision oscilloscope. This is an 
essential step for solving larger instances of the problem (see section <A HREF="#psize">
3.6</A>),<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Finding cables long enough so that larger instances of 
the problem could be solve. This problem might have a simple solution: the 
internet networks connecting the world cities. It is easy to find cables of 
hundreds of kilometers connecting distant cities. This will help us to solve 
instance of more than 10 nodes. However, this solution introduces a difficulty 
too: cables of certain lengths must be found or the system must be rescaled in 
order to fit the existing lengths.</UL>

The way in which light can be used for performing useful computations has been 
suggested in this paper. The techniques are based on the massive parallelism of 
the light ray.<BR>
<BR>
It has been shown the way in which a light-based device can be used for solving 
the Hamiltonian path problem. Using the today technology we can build a 
light-based device which can solve small and medium size instances in several 
seconds.<BR>
<BR>
Further work directions will be focused on:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Implementing the proposed hardware,<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Finding optimal labeling systems for particular graphs. 
This will reduce the length of the involved cables significantly,<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Finding other non-trivial problems which can be solved by 
using the proposed device,<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Finding other ways to introduce delays in the system. The 
current solution requires cables that are too long and too expensive,<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Using other type of signals instead of light. A possible 
candidate would be electric power,<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Finding other ways to implement the system of marking the 
signals which pass through a particular node. This will be very useful because 
the currently suggested system, based on delays, is too time consuming.</UL>
